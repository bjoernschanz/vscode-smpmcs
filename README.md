# Visual Studio Code Extension for SMP/E MCS

In my workplace, it is a convention to install every tiny modification of the system configuration using Usermods in SMP/E. 
That's why I write a lot of MC statements. To make my work easier and to modernize the handling of SMP/E, I started writing a VSCode extension for SMP/E MCS statements.

This work based on interpretation of [IBM - SMP/E modification control statements](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/3.1.0?topic=reference-smpe-modification-control-statements).
SMP/E is the property of IBM.
